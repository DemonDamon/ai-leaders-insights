## Introduction

The healthcare industry is undergoing a profound transformation driven by escalating costs, workforce shortages, and increasing demands from aging populations. Globally, healthcare systems face critical challenges, such as limited access to care, inefficiencies, and high expenses [[1](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR1 "Yeganeh H. An analysis of emerging trends and transformations in global healthcare. Int J Health Gov. 2019;24(2):169–80.")]. These issues are particularly severe in low- and middle-income countries, where shortages of trained healthcare professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited diagnostic capabilities often result in delayed disease detection, suboptimal treatments, and poorer patient outcomes. Addressing these challenges requires innovative, scalable solutions capable of improving efficiency, expanding access, and enhancing quality of care across diverse healthcare environments [[2](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR2 "Tabish SA, Nabil S. Future of healthcare delivery: strategies that will reshape the healthcare industry landscape. Int J Sci Res. 2015;4(2):727–58.")].

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the study of how computers can learn to solve problems using symbolic language [[3](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR3 "Sheth A, Roy K, Gaur M. Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (why, what, and how). IEEE Intell Syst. 2023;38(3):56–62.")]. Many fields, including medicine, pharmaceutics, and more, have benefited from its development, and it has become a core research method for resolving issues [[4](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR4 "Suriyaamporn P, et al. The artificial intelligence-powered new era in pharmaceutical research and development: a review. AAPS PharmSciTech. 2024;25(6):188.")]. It offers promising tools for transforming healthcare delivery through advanced data analysis and decision support. AI systems, powered by machine learning (ML), can process vast amounts of patient information, including medical histories, test results, treatment responses, and clinical guidelines, to develop personalized care strategies [[5](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR5 "Patil S, Shankar H. Transforming healthcare: harnessing the power of AI in the modern era. Int J Multidiscip Sci Arts. 2023;2(2):60–70.")]. These technologies assist clinicians by recommending optimal therapies based on individual health profiles and by continuously monitoring vital signs to detect early signs of complications. A key advantage of AI is its ability to identify hidden patterns in large data sets, enabling predictions about disease progression, treatment outcomes, and patient risk factors [[6](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR6 "Ahmed Z, et al. Artificial intelligence with multi-functional machine learning platform development for better healthcare and precision medicine. Database. 2020;2020:baaaa010.")]. Such predictive capabilities facilitate early interventions, preventive care, and more precise allocation of resources. Despite its potential, the adoption of AI in healthcare faces significant challenges, including ethical considerations regarding patient privacy, data security, and mitigating algorithmic biases arising from historical data [[7](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR7 "Shoghli A, Darvish M, Sadeghian Y. Balancing innovation and privacy: ethical challenges in AI-driven healthcare. J Rev Med Sci. 2024;4(1):1–11.")].

                .")]. Although these advancements greatly expedite the advancement of healthcare AI, meticulous consideration is necessary to address issues associated with data quality, privacy, and potential biases present in synthetic data sets.

## AI applications in medicine and healthcare

### Integration of AI in electronic health records

The integration of AI into electronic health records (EHRs) represents a pivotal advancement in the management and utilization of patient data for clinical decision-making [[24](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR24 "Olusegun, J., et al., Integration of AI with electronic health records: enhancing clinical workflows. 2024.")]. By analyzing electronic health records and real time data, AI systems detect diseases earlier and more accurately than traditional approaches. EHRs, which encompass comprehensive patient histories, laboratory results, and treatment documentation, generate extensive data sets that AI systems can analyze to extract actionable insights [[25](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR25 "Mohsen F, et al. Artificial intelligence-based methods for fusion of electronic health records and imaging data. Sci Rep. 2022;12(1):17981.")]. AI-powered EHR systems can identify patterns related to disease onset, treatment effectiveness, and patient safety issues more quickly than traditional methods. For example, algorithms can monitor medication interactions and alert providers to potential adverse events in real time. In addition, AI applications in EHR can improve disease surveillance, support population health management, and optimize resource allocation by predicting hospital admissions or staff workload requirements [[26](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR26 "Moafa KMY, et al. Artificial intelligence for improved health management: application, uses, opportunities, and challenges-a systematic review. Egypt J Chem. 2024;67(13):865–80.")]. ML models, such as those investigated by *Rajkomar* et al*.,* have Been applied to EHRs to predict critical clinical outcomes including in-hospital mortality, hospital readmissions, and the onset of sepsis with higher accuracy than conventional scoring systems, Their study notably demonstrated that DL techniques could process unstructured EHR data, such as free-text clinical notes, achieving predictive accuracies exceeding 85%, thereby significantly outperforming manual methods [[27](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR27 "Rajkomar A, et al. Scalable and accurate deep learning with electronic health records. NPJ Digit Med. 2018;1(1):18.")]. *Friedman* et al*.,* illustrated how NLP can extract clinically relevant information such as symptom descriptions or medication adjustments from physicians’ notes, thereby supporting real-time clinical decision-making. This capacity is particularly valuable for risk stratification, where AI identifies high-risk individuals who may benefit from preventive care interventions [[28](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR28 "Friedman C, Elhadad N. Natural language processing in health care and biomedicine. In: Biomedical informatics: computer applications in health care and biomedicine. London: Springer; 2014.")]. *Obermeyer* et al*.,* demonstrated the utility of predictive analytics in population health management by identifying patients requiring proactive care strategies [[29](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR29 "Obermeyer Z, et al. Dissecting racial bias in an algorithm used to manage the health of populations. Science. 2019;366(6464):447–53.")]. In addition to clinical applications, AI-driven EHR systems contribute to operational efficiency by automating administrative processes, such as medical coding and billing. This reduces the documentation burden on healthcare providers, as emphasized by *Davenport and Kalakota* [[30](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR30 "Davenport T, Kalakota R. The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare. Future Healthc J. 2019;6(2):94–8.")]. Nonetheless, several challenges hinder the seamless integration of AI into EHR systems. These include issues of data interoperability across disparate platforms and concerns regarding data privacy and security, as highlighted by *Abouelmehdi* et al*.* [[31](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR31 "He J, et al. The practical implementation of artificial intelligence technologies in medicine. Nat Med. 2019;25(1):30–6.")].

### Personalized medicine and treatment plans

AI's capacity to design personalized medicine and treatment regimens signifies a critical paradigm shift from standardized clinical protocols to individualized patient care [[32](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR32 "Mulukuntla S, Venkata SP. AI-driven personalized medicine: assessing the impact of federal policies on advancing patient-centric care. EPH-Int J Med Health Sci. 2020;6(2):20–6.")]. Through the integration and analysis of patient-specific data, such as genomic sequences, lifestyle patterns, and detailed medical histories, AI systems are capable of generating customized therapeutic strategies [[33](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR33 "Parekh A-DE, et al. Artificial intelligence (AI) in personalized medicine: AI-generated personalized therapy regimens based on genetic and medical history. Ann Med Surg. 2023;85(11):5831–3.")], as shown in Fig. [2](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#Fig2) [[34](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR34 "Bhattamisra SK, et al. Artificial intelligence in pharmaceutical and healthcare research. Big Data Cogn Comput. 2023;7(1):10.")]. Moreover, AI enables personalized medicine by tailoring treatments to individual profiles. *Collins* et al*.,* demonstrated that AI algorithms can identify genetic mutations associated with rare diseases and subsequently recommend targeted therapies, enhancing patient response rates By up to 30% when compared to conventional treatment approaches [[35](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR35 "Quazi S. Artificial intelligence and machine learning in precision and genomic medicine. Med Oncol. 2022;39(8):120.")]. In contrast to broad spectrum interventions, these AI-driven plans are designed to minimize adverse effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy, especially in chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. The clinical utility of AI extends further, as evidenced by *Patel* et al*.,* who illustrated the application of AI in the real-time adjustment of insulin dosages for diabetic patients as by utilizing data from continuous glucose monitoring systems, AI facilitates more precise glycemic control, thereby highlighting its transformative potential in tailoring interventions to individual biological profiles [[36](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR36 "Vettoretti M, et al. Advanced diabetes management using artificial intelligence and continuous glucose monitoring sensors. Sensors. 2020;20(14):3870.")]. In addition to therapeutic personalization, AI enhances treatment optimization by integrating imaging modalities with patient-specific data. *Gupta* et al*.,* demonstrated how AI can synthesize MRI data with genetic markers to develop individualized radiotherapy schedules for Brain tumor patients, resulting in a 25% increase in tumor control rates [[37](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR37 "Jena B, et al. Brain tumor characterization using radiogenomics in artificial intelligence framework. Cancers (Basel). 2022;14(16):4052.")]. This integrative approach allows for treatments that are not only personalized but also dynamically responsive to evolving patient conditions, offering a level of clinical adaptability that surpasses traditional, static treatment protocols. Beyond tailoring treatment, AI’s predictive capacity enables early identification of risks, laying the groundwork for proactive disease prevention.

Deep learning on histopathological images for colorectal cancer diagnosis: a systematic review. Diagnostics. 2022;12(4):837.")]. For treatment, AI supports optimization by predicting patient responses to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, enabling more personalized and effective interventions. In prognosis, AI-based models integrate multidimensional clinical and molecular data to predict recurrence and estimate survival more accurately than conventional statistical methods [[97](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR97 "Deepali N, Goel, Khandnor P.

#### AI in breast cancer

Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide [[101](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR101 "Giaquinto AN, et al. Breast cancer statistics, 2022. CA Cancer J Clin. 2022;72(6):524–41.")]. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) can improve treatment outcomes, but patient responses vary considerably [[102](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR102 "Filho OM, et al. Impact of HER2 heterogeneity on treatment response of early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: phase II neoadjuvant clinical trial of T-DM1 combined with pertuzumab. Cancer Discov. 2021;11(10):2474–87.")]. Conventional approaches for evaluating NAT response, such as histopathology and biomarker assessment, are limited in accuracy and efficiency [[103](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR103 "Dowling GP, et al. Predictive value of pretreatment circulating inflammatory response markers in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer: meta-analysis. Br J Surg. 2024;111(5):znae132.")]. AI has advanced the prediction of NAT efficacy by integrating digital pathology with computational models, allowing individualized evaluation before systemic treatment, as shown in Fig. [5](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#Fig5) [[104](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR104 "Ji J, et al. Artificial intelligence-based pathology to assist prediction of neoadjuvant therapy responses for breast cancer. Cancer Med. 2025;14(15):e71132.")]. Pathomics extends beyond traditional H&E staining by incorporating molecular markers (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67, and PD-L1) along with genomic and proteomic data that reflect tumor sensitivity to therapies. By merging these diverse features with AI, researchers can more accurately predict responses to neoadjuvant regimens in breast cancer [[104](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR104 "Ji J, et al. Artificial intelligence-based pathology to assist prediction of neoadjuvant therapy responses for breast cancer. Cancer Med. 2025;14(15):e71132.")]. Several AI models demonstrate these applications such as *Cruz-Roa* et al*.* who developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classified invasive ductal carcinoma patches from whole-slide images (WSI) and estimated infiltration using a ConvNet classifier [[105](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR105 "Cruz-Roa A, et al. Accurate and reproducible invasive breast cancer detection in whole-slide images: a deep learning approach for quantifying tumor extent. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1):46450.")]. While *Han* et al*.* reported DL model with an average accuracy of 93.2% across eight classes (four benign and four malignant) [[106](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR106 "Han Z, et al. Breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images with structured deep learning model. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1):4172.")]. *Luo* et al*.* proposed a deep learning-based clinical risk stratification model for overall survival in young women with breast cancer, integrating histological features with clinical data to outperform conventional prognostic tools [[107](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR107 "Luo J, et al. A deep-learning-based clinical risk stratification for overall survival in adolescent and young adult women with breast cancer. J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2023;149(12):10423–33.")]. Similarly, *Huang* et al*.* developed a model to improve histological grading and predict upstaging of atypical ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ from biopsies [[108](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR108 "Huang CY, et al. Deep-learning model to improve histological grading and predict upstaging of atypical ductal hyperplasia/ductal carcinoma in situ on breast biopsy. Histopathology. 2024;84(6):983–1002.")]. In addition, AI models analyzing pre- and post-treatment imaging features help anticipate response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, recurrence risk, and survival outcomes. This predictive capability enables clinicians to tailor therapy according to tumor biology and expected treatment sensitivity, supporting the transition toward more precise and personalized breast cancer care.

#### AI in lung cancer

Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality [[109](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR109 "Siegel RL, et al. Cancer statistics, 2022. CA Cancer J Clin. 2022. 
                  https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21708
                  
                .")]. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 have demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only about 30% of patients are eligible for these therapies, and immune-related adverse events remain a clinical challenge [[110](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR110 "Yan W, et al. Applicability analysis of immunotherapy for lung cancer patients based on deep learning. Methods. 2022;205:149–56."), [111](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR111 "Weber D, et al. Accurate detection of tumor-specific gene fusions reveals strongly immunogenic personal neo-antigens. Nat Biotechnol. 2022;40(8):1276–84.")]. Traditional evaluation methods are often insufficient for predicting therapeutic benefit, highlighting the need for more advanced approaches. AI-based technologies addressing these challenges in lung cancer immunotherapy are summarized in Fig. [6](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#Fig6) [[112](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR112 "Gao Q, et al. The artificial intelligence and machine learning in lung cancer immunotherapy. J Hematol Oncol. 2023;16(1):55.")]. AI has emerged as a powerful tool in lung cancer care, contributing to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment optimization. ML model can distinguish benign from malignant nodules, monitor tumor growth, and enhance bronchoscopic procedures by improving diagnostic accuracy and lymph node sampling yield [[113](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR113 "Ashraf SF, et al. Predicting benign, preinvasive, and invasive lung nodules on computed tomography scans using machine learning. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2022;163(4):1496–505.")]. The prediction of therapy efficacy can be classified into direct predictions and indirect predictions. Common approaches such as radiomics, pathomics, and genomics can indirectly predict the relationship between PD-L1, TMB, and other biomarkers with survival and therapy efficacy. Conversely, proteomics and laboratory inspection data are mainly utilized for direct predictions. In pathology, AI automates tissue analysis, improving diagnostic accuracy, classification of lung cancer subtypes, and prognostic assessment [[114](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR114 "Wang S, et al. Artificial intelligence in lung cancer pathology image analysis. Cancers. 2019;11(11):1673.")]. Together, these applications support precision oncology by enabling individualized, data-driven interventions that improve survival outcomes. A predictive model for lymph vascular invasion (LVI) and nodal involvement achieved a sensitivity of 75.8%, specificity of 67.6%, accuracy of 70.8%, and an AUC of 0.77 [[100](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR100 "Rathore S, et al. Novel structural descriptors for automated colon cancer detection and grading.

Deep learning for prediction of N2 metastasis and survival for clinical stage I non–small cell lung cancer. Radiology. 2022;302(1):200–11.")]. *Yan’s* team trained a DL-based detection model on the LUNA16 public database and validated it on the Anti-PD-1\_Lung data set, demonstrating the ability to predict immunotherapy response [[110](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR110 "Yan W, et al. Applicability analysis of immunotherapy for lung cancer patients based on deep learning. Methods. 2022;205:149–56.")]. Similarly, *Mu* et al*.* extracted features from PET–CT images obtained before ICI treatment and developed a predictive model for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) [[116](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR116 "Prelaj A, et al. Machine learning using real-world and translational data to improve treatment selection for NSCLC patients treated with immunotherapy. Cancers (Basel). 2022;14(2):435.")]. Beyond cancer care, AI applications are also reshaping patient engagement and chronic disease management, particularly through the development of virtual health assistants that provide continuous monitoring, personalized guidance, and decision support.

### Development of virtual health assistants

Virtual Health Assistants (VHAs) are broadly defined as AI-driven platforms that interact with patients to provide health-related information, reminders, or support. The development of VHAs has transformed patient engagement and healthcare accessibility through the integration of advanced AI technologies, particularly NLP and conversational AI [[117](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR117 "Bacha A, Shah HH. Ai-powered virtual health assistants: transforming patient care and engagement. Glob Insights Artif Intell Comput. 2025;1(1):15–30.")]. Within this category, *chatbots* represent a specific subset focused primarily on text- or voice-based conversational exchanges, whereas more advanced VHAs may include multimodal systems such as voice-activated agents and relational agents designed to establish trust and rapport with users. Early chatbot implementations such as the Ada Health app employ machine learning to assess symptoms and suggest potential diagnoses, with studies showing Alignment with physician recommendations in more than 70% of cases [[118](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR118 "Jungmann SM, et al. Accuracy of a chatbot (Ada) in the diagnosis of mental disorders: comparative case study with lay and expert users. JMIR Form Res. 2019;3(4):e13863.")]. In contrast, voice-based VHAs like Amazon Alexa with healthcare functionalities assist elderly patients in managing chronic conditions, while relational agents explored by *Bickmore* et al*.* are designed to simulate human-like interaction, thereby improving user engagement and long-term adherence [[119](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR119 "Bickmore TW, et al. ‘It’s just like you talk to a friend’relational agents for older adults. Interact Comput. 2005;17(6):711–35.")]. *De Choudhury* et al*.* showed that conversational agents can analyze linguistic patterns to detect early signs of depression or anxiety, enabling timely interventions [[120](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR120 "De Choudhury, M., et al. Predicting depression via social media.")]. Similarly, *Miner* et al*.* highlighted their potential to support acute psychological needs, such as guiding patients through relaxation techniques during panic attacks [[121](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR121 "Miner AS, et al. Smartphone-based conversational agents and responses to questions about mental health, interpersonal violence, and physical health. JAMA Intern Med. 2016;176(5):619–25.")]. Despite these benefits, adoption rates remain uneven and are influenced by factors, such as age, digital literacy, cultural perceptions, and levels of trust in AI systems. Patients often express greater willingness to use VHAs when transparency, data privacy, and human oversight are emphasized, while skepticism persists regarding their clinical reliability and ethical use. Current systems may misinterpret ambiguous or context-specific language, struggle with complex medical terminology, or fail to recognize cultural nuances, which can undermine trust and safety. Cost-effective assessments are necessary to ensure sustainable implementation, as the development and deployment of VHAs can involve substantial financial investment.

### AI integration with wearable devices

Modern wearable health technologies have progressed from simple biometric trackers to intelligent monitoring systems through the integration of AI [[122](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR122 "Secara I-A, Hordiiuk D. Personalized health monitoring systems: integrating wearable and AI. J Intell Learn Syst Appl. 2024;16(2):44–52.")]. These devices now process continuous streams of physiological data to detect health patterns, predict risks, and deliver personalized recommendations, establishing a proactive, data-driven model of wellness management. They capture key health metrics including cardiovascular function, metabolic indicators, and behavioral patterns generating longitudinal data sets essential for identifying trends and enabling timely interventions [[123](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR123 "Kang HS, Exworthy M. Wearing the future—wearables to empower users to take greater responsibility for their health and care: scoping review. JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2022;10(7):e35684.")]. Research highlights their particular value in chronic disease management, where real-time physiological monitoring enhances clinical decision-making [[124](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR124 "Lu L, et al. Wearable health devices in health care: narrative systematic review. JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2020;8(11):e18907.")]. AI transforms wearables from passive data collectors into active diagnostic assistants through advanced signal processing and pattern recognition. ML architectures extract clinically meaningful insights from biometric streams, while DL models detect subtle pathological signatures, such as arrhythmias in ECG waveforms or early hypertension indicators in blood pressure trends. Wearable technologies include smartwatches, fitness trackers, and medical-grade sensors capable of monitoring parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, sleep quality, and physical activity [[125](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR125 "George ASH, Shahul A, George AS. Wearable sensors: A new way to track health and wellness. Partn Universal Int Innov J. 2023;1(4):15–34.")]. In diabetes care, AI-enhanced continuous glucose monitors provide real-time glycemic feedback and analyze behavioral data to optimize diet and activity, representing a major shift in self-management [[126](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR126 "Salinari A, et al. The application of digital technologies and artificial intelligence in healthcare: an overview on nutrition assessment. Dis. 2023;11(3):97.")]. The integration of advanced sensors with ML promises even deeper insights into health, positioning wearables as central tools in the future of personalized healthcare delivery. Building on these examples of AI-enabled personalized healthcare tools, Table [2](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#Tab2) highlights landmark studies and clinically deployed AI systems across multiple medical domains, illustrating how AI translates from research into practical, real-world applications.

## Challenges and existing solutions

### Data integration and interoperability

#### Challenges

In smart healthcare, data heterogeneity hinders AI adoption, because variations in structures, formats, and standards complicate integration across departments, institutions, and medical systems. This challenge spans structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, as well as diverse modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video, each requiring specialized processing. Even within similar data types, inconsistencies like differing disease coding systems add complexity. Addressing these issues requires unified standards, robust cross-system conversion tools, and advanced machine learning methods to harmonize data sets and support reliable, scalable AI applications [[137](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR137 "Tayefi M, et al. Challenges and opportunities beyond structured data in analysis of electronic health records. Wiley Interdiscip Rev Comput Stat. 2021;13(6):e1549.")].

#### Existing solutions

Several strategies support data integration and interoperability in healthcare. The Artificial Intelligence Modern Data Platform (AIMDP) manages both structured and unstructured information such as lab results, monitoring data, and clinical notes to generate insights that guide treatment decisions [[138](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR138 "Ortega-Calvo AS, et al. Aimdp: an artificial intelligence modern data platform. Use case for Spanish national health service data silo. Future Gener Comput Syst. 2023;143:248–64.")]. Data harmonization pipelines convert diverse data sets into unified formats using the FHIR standard, ensuring consistency and usability for AI applications, such as integrating blood glucose, weight, and dietary records in diabetes management. Direct adoption of Health Level 7 FHIR standards further enables seamless data modeling and exchange across institutions, allowing oncology specialists in different hospitals to access shared genetic, treatment, and clinical information for coordinated, personalized cancer care [[139](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR139 "Williams E, et al. A standardized clinical data harmonization pipeline for scalable AI application deployment (FHIR-DHP): validation and usability study. JMIR Med Inform. 2023;11:e43847."), [140](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR140 "Sinaci AA, et al. A data transformation methodology to create findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable health data: software design, development, and evaluation study. J Med Internet Res. 2023;25:e42822.")].

### Large-scale data handling

#### Challenges

Healthcare is experiencing unprecedented data growth from electronic health records (EHRs), wearable devices, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, imaging, clinical notes, and genomics [[141](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR141 "Cai Q, et al. A survey on multimodal data-driven smart healthcare systems: approaches and applications. IEEE Access. 2019;7:133583–99.")]. The scale, diversity, and velocity of these data sets often exceed the capabilities of traditional data management systems, creating difficulties in storage, processing, and integration. Radiology departments, for instance, generate terabytes of imaging data annually, while EHRs capture detailed patient histories and treatment outcomes. AI provides powerful tools for analysis, its success relies heavily on advances in underlying data infrastructure [[142](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR142 "Althati C, Tomar M, Shanmugam L. Enhancing data integration and management: the role of AI and machine learning in modern data platforms. J Artif Intell General Sci. 2024;2(1):220–32.")]. Without scalable platforms, efficient analytics, and robust governance, the potential of AI in healthcare remains limited.

#### Existing solutions

To address these challenges, several approaches have been proposed, including ML, agent-based, heuristic, cloud-based, and hybrid mechanisms, though each poses trade-offs in resource use, privacy, and complexity [[143](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR143 "Pashazadeh A, Navimipour NJ. Big data handling mechanisms in the healthcare applications: a comprehensive and systematic literature review. J Biomed Inform. 2018;82:47–62.")]. Distributed frameworks, such as Hadoop, using MapReduce, have been applied in projects like the Mayo Clinic to aggregate large-scale EHRs [[144](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR144 "Kalia K, Gupta N. Analysis of hadoop mapreduce scheduling in heterogeneous environment. Ain Shams Eng J. 2021;12(1):1101–10.")]. Apache Spark provides in-memory processing that accelerates genomic analyses in initiatives such as Genomics England, though it demands significant resources [[145](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR145 "Khalil WA, Torkey H, Attiya G. Survey of Apache Spark optimized job scheduling in Big Data. Int J Ind Sustain Dev. 2020;1(1):39–48.")]. Data mining techniques also support predictive modeling, as demonstrated in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), where decision trees and neural networks were applied to assess health risks and guide personalized care.

### Real-time processing

#### Challenges

In smart healthcare, the rapid growth of IoT devices has generated vast amounts of data requiring real-time processing, which traditional cloud-based methods struggle to handle due to latency issues. To address this, fog and edge computing has emerged as effective solutions by decentralizing data processing and bringing computation closer to the data source. Edge computing enables immediate analytics at the device level, such as wearable monitors analyzing patient vitals in real time. In contrast, fog computing provides additional storage and processing at intermediate nodes, supporting larger tasks like integrating data across a hospital network. Together, these approaches reduce latency, improve efficiency, and enhance the responsiveness of intelligent healthcare systems [[146](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR146 "Surianarayanan C, et al. A survey on optimization techniques for edge artificial intelligence (AI). Sensors. 2023;23(3):1279.")].

#### Existing solutions

To overcome these challenges, decentralized computing approaches such as edge and fog computing have been developed. Edge computing enables real-time analytics at or near devices, as in wearable monitors that process patient vitals locally, while AI tasks can be divided between reasoning at the edge and training in the cloud [[147](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR147 "Hua H, et al. Edge computing with artificial intelligence: a machine learning perspective. ACM Comput Surv. 2023;55(9):1–35.")]. Advanced frameworks like Smart-Edge-CoCaCo further improve efficiency by coordinating communication, caching, and computation [[148](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR148 "Khanh QV, et al. An integrating computing framework based on edge-fog-cloud for internet of healthcare things applications. Internet Things. 2023;23:100907.")]. Fog computing, positioned between edge and cloud, provides greater storage and processing capacity, making it suitable for hospital-wide data integration. When combined with DL, fog systems have been applied in intelligent medical monitoring, where physiological data are processed efficiently to deliver timely and accurate health insights.

### Model interpretability

#### Challenges

A major challenge in healthcare AI is the opacity of ML and DL models, which often operate as “black boxes” that provide predictions without revealing the reasoning behind them. This lack of transparency undermines clinical trust, complicates validation of AI-driven diagnoses, and limits patient confidence in their care. For example, an AI system may suggest a diagnosis without clarifying which features influenced the result, reducing its reliability in evidence-based practice. To address this, interpretable models are needed to clarify decision-making processes, highlight key features, and foster trust among clinicians and patients [[149](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR149 "Wani NA, Kumar R, Bedi J. Deepxplainer: an interpretable deep learning based approach for lung cancer detection using explainable artificial intelligence. Comput Methods Programs Biomed. 2024;243:107879.")].

#### Existing solutions

To overcome these challenges, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been developed to reveal how models generate predictions by identifying feature importance, correlations, and reasoning pathways [[150](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR150 "Kök I, et al. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for internet of things: a survey. IEEE Internet Things J. 2023;10(16):14764–79.")]. Common methods include LIME, which approximates local model behavior; SHAP, which quantifies feature contributions; Grad-CAM, which highlights image regions influencing predictions; and t-SNE, which visualizes high-dimensional data. These tools are increasingly applied in healthcare for instance, Grad-CAM has been used to locate areas of concern in retinal images for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, while SHAP helps interpret factors contributing to patient readmission risks. By improving transparency and accountability, XAI enhances the usability, reliability, and acceptance of AI systems in clinical practice [[151](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR151 "Band SS, et al. Application of explainable artificial intelligence in medical health: a systematic review of interpretability methods. Inf Med Unlocked. 2023;40:101286.")].

### Continuous learning and adaptability

#### Challenges

AI in healthcare faces difficulties in continuous learning, as medical knowledge, treatments, and practices evolve rapidly. Models trained on static data sets risk becoming outdated, leading to declining accuracy over time [[152](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR152 "Liu B. Lifelong machine learning: a paradigm for continuous learning. Front Comput Sci. 2017;11(3):359–61.")]. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this limitation, as diagnostic tools needed rapid adaptation to emerging variants and shifting clinical protocols. Similarly, advances such as CAR-T therapies and robot-assisted surgeries require AI systems to incorporate new evidence to remain clinically relevant. Examples like IBM Watson Health, which updates its knowledge base with current research and trial data, underscore the importance of regular model refinement to sustain accuracy, effectiveness, and trustworthiness [[153](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR153 "Feng J, et al. Clinical artificial intelligence quality improvement: towards continual monitoring and updating of AI algorithms in healthcare. NPJ Digit Med. 2022;5(1):66.")].

#### Existing solutions

To overcome these challenges, continuous learning techniques have been introduced to enable AI models to adapt to evolving data and practices [[154](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR154 "Garg SK, et al. Accuracy and safety of Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitoring in adults with diabetes. Diabetes Technol Ther. 2022;24(6):373–80.")]. Applications include Dexcom’s glucose monitors adjusting insulin doses in real time, BlueDot issuing early outbreak alerts during COVID-19, and Tempus Labs refining genomic-based therapies. A key obstacle is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge disrupts previously learned information. Strategies to address this include regularization, replay, optimization, representation learning, and architecture-based methods [[155](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR155 "Allam, Z., The rise of machine intelligence in the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on health policy. Surveying the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Implications, 2020: 89.")]. Practical implementations, such as pairing a k-NN classifier with a fixed pre-trained feature extractor, help maintain adaptability while controlling computational and storage demands, ensuring AI systems remain reliable in dynamic healthcare environments [[156](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR156 "Prabhu, A., et al., Online continual learning without the storage constraint. arXiv preprint 
                  arXiv:2305.09253
                  
                , 2023.")].

### Security of AI models

#### Challenges

AI in healthcare faces critical security threats across all stages of operation, from data collection to preprocessing, training, and inference. Sensitive medical data are exposed to risks such as sensor spoofing during acquisition, scaling attacks during preprocessing, and adversarial manipulations that subtly alter inputs to trigger incorrect predictions or compromise privacy. These vulnerabilities undermine both patient safety and system integrity. Protecting data sources from tampering and enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks are, therefore, essential to building secure and trustworthy AI-driven healthcare systems [[157](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR157 "Hu Y, et al. Artificial intelligence security: threats and countermeasures. ACM Comput Surv. 2021;55(1):1–36.")].

#### Existing solutions

To overcome these challenges, multiple defensive strategies have been developed. Remote monitoring systems, such as glucose and heart-rate sensors, employ anomaly detection and data fusion with EHRs to identify falsified signals. In medical imaging, robust scaling algorithms and median filters preserve diagnostic accuracy by correcting artifacts and restoring image quality. To counter adversarial attacks, techniques such as adversarial retraining, data cleaning, and input reconstruction improve model resilience, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) are used to simulate attacks and generate high-quality training images that strengthen predictive performance [[158](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR158 "Qayyum A, et al. Secure and robust machine learning for healthcare: a survey. IEEE Rev Biomed Eng. 2020;14:156–80.")]. Collectively, these approaches enhance data integrity, diagnostic precision, and the overall robustness of healthcare AI systems.

### Ethical AI design

#### Challenges

Ensuring ethical AI in healthcare requires integrating fairness, safety, privacy, and accountability into systems from the design stage rather than as afterthoughts [[159](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR159 "Goktas P, Grzybowski A. Shaping the future of healthcare: ethical clinical challenges and pathways to trustworthy AI. J Clin Med. 2025;14(5):1605.")]. A major challenge is determining responsibility when errors occur, as opaque model decisions make it difficult to attribute liability between clinicians, developers, and institutions. Bias also poses a significant risk, often stemming from imbalanced data sets or flawed design, which can reinforce healthcare inequalities. Furthermore, managing sensitive patient data raises privacy concerns, where breaches threaten both ethical and legal standards [[160](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR160 "Ueda D, et al. Fairness of artificial intelligence in healthcare: review and recommendations. Jpn J Radiol. 2024;42(1):3–15.")]. These challenges underscore the need for fairness, transparency, and accountability in building trustworthy AI systems.

#### Existing solutions

To overcome these challenges, ethical AI frameworks emphasize accountability, fairness, and privacy. Clear responsibility guidelines are needed to define the roles of developers, clinicians, and users in cases of errors. Bias mitigation strategies include using diverse data sets, conducting fairness audits, validating models across populations, and educating stakeholders, with combined approaches offering the most effective outcomes [[161](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR161 "Pagano TP, et al. Bias and unfairness in machine learning models: a systematic review on datasets, tools, fairness metrics, and identification and mitigation methods. Big Data Cogn Comput. 2023;7(1):15.")]. Patient privacy can be safeguarded through encryption, anonymization, and differential privacy, while advanced techniques such as federated learning enable collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Homomorphic encryption further allows computations on encrypted data sets, supporting secure data use. Collectively, these approaches provide practical pathways toward transparent, fair, and privacy-preserving AI in healthcare [[162](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR162 "Kucukkaya A, et al. Equality, diversity, and inclusion in artificial intelligence-driven healthcare chatbots addressing challenges and shaping strategies. Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs. 2025;1:105.")].

### Scalability

#### Challenges

Scalability remains a significant challenge in deploying AI in healthcare, as models that perform well in small-scale trials often struggle to maintain accuracy, speed, and integration when applied across large national systems. The vast volumes of patient data, diverse medical conditions, and the need for compatibility with different healthcare IT infrastructures complicate large-scale implementation. Addressing this requires advanced data processing strategies and robust system architectures, as demonstrated by the Mayo Clinic, which enhanced its processing modules to manage nationwide medical data efficiently, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy, response time, and overall system reliability [[163](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR163 "Gao X, et al. Artificial intelligence applications in smart healthcare: a survey. Futur Int. 2024;16(9):308.")].

#### Existing solutions

Modular architecture and cloud computing are widely adopted solutions to achieve scalability in healthcare AI. As demonstrated by Mount Sinai's Modular Health Information System, modular systems divide applications into independent, task-specific units that can operate concurrently, enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability. Cloud platforms such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS) support scalability by dynamically adjusting computational and storage resources to meet workload demands [[164](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR164 "Wittig, A. and M. Wittig, Amazon Web Services in Action: An in-depth guide to AWS. 2023: Simon and Schuster.")]. This enables efficient Handling of large medical data sets while ensuring security and reliability. In addition, new Benchmarking methodologies such as BigDataBench 4.0 and Mystique have emerged to replace traditional, non-scalable approaches, offering realistic frameworks for evaluating the performance of big data and AI systems in healthcare contexts [[165](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR165 "Liang, M., et al. Mystique: Enabling accurate and scalable generation of production ai benchmarks.")].

### Underserved and remote areas with limited connectivity

#### Challenges

Deploying AI in resource-limited and remote healthcare settings faces major hurdles due to unstable or absent internet connectivity, which restricts real-time analytics, data uploading, and system updates. To address these challenges, offline AI models and portable devices have been developed to function independently of continuous network access [[166](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR166 "Amjad A, Kordel P, Fernandes G. A review on innovation in healthcare sector (telehealth) through artificial intelligence. Sustainability. 2023;15(8):6655.")]. For example, GE Healthcare’s portable ultrasound systems can perform local image analysis and store results for later upload, enabling immediate diagnoses even in low-connectivity regions. Such offline AI solutions ensure reliable diagnostic support and make healthcare more accessible in resource-constrained environments [[167](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR167 "Uschnig C, et al. Tele-ultrasound in the era of COVID-19: a practical guide. Ultrasound Med Biol. 2022;48(6):965–74.")].

#### Existing solutions

Several strategies can complement edge and fog computing to enhance the deployment of AI in resource-limited healthcare environments. Offline AI models allow devices like GE Healthcare’s portable ultrasound systems to provide immediate diagnoses without internet access by storing results locally [[168](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR168 "Rao DP, et al. Evaluation of an offline, artificial intelligence system for referable glaucoma screening using a smartphone-based fundus camera: a prospective study. Eye. 2024;38(6):1104–11.")]. Data compression techniques, such as Gzip and Brotli, used in wearable devices like Fitbit, reduce transmission demands in low-bandwidth settings [[169](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR169 "Wang C-H, et al. Lightweight deep learning: an overview. IEEE Consum Electron Mag. 2022;13(4):51–64.")]. Lightweight AI models, including MobileNet and TinyYOLO, enable real-time analysis on low-power devices, with Huawei’s Atlas 200 accelerator card exemplifying their effectiveness. In addition, low-bandwidth optimization methods, such as adaptive compression algorithms employed in drone-based disaster relief, improve data transfer efficiency under unstable network conditions [[163](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR163 "Gao X, et al. Artificial intelligence applications in smart healthcare: a survey. Futur Int. 2024;16(9):308.")]. These approaches enhance the accessibility, reliability, and resilience of AI systems in underserved and remote healthcare settings, helping to bridge the gap between advanced digital technologies and real-world clinical needs.

## Bias in healthcare AI and mitigation strategies

### Sources of bias

#### Data biases

Most areas of human research remain heavily biased toward participants with a Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) profile [[170](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR170 "Henrich J, Heine SJ, Norenzayan A. The weirdest people in the world? Behav Brain Sci. 2010;33(2–3):61–83.")], making them unrepresentative of the global population. Since many data sets used to train AI are derived from such studies, these biases are inherited by algorithms. Some data set biases, like ethnicity in skin images or gender in genetics, are easy to detect, while others, such as socioeconomic status or sexual orientation, require explicit metadata. Even seemingly unrelated metadata can be crucial for identifying bias [[171](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR171 "Ellwood-Lowe ME, et al. Time-varying effects of income on hippocampal volume trajectories in adolescent girls. Dev Cogn Neurosci. 2018;30:41–50.")]. For instance, neuroscience research has shown that socioeconomic variables correlate with detectable differences in brain structure and function [[172](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR172 "Hackman DA, Farah MJ, Meaney MJ. Socioeconomic status and the brain: mechanistic insights from human and animal research. Nat Rev Neurosci. 2010;11(9):651–9.")]. To properly evaluate such influences, future studies must incorporate standardized metadata on factors that may introduce bias.

#### Algorithmic biases

When algorithms are trained on Biased data sets, they tend to reinforce patterns from the dominant class. For example, if a data set contains 80% Healthy and 20% diseased images, an algorithm could achieve 80% accuracy simply by labeling all samples as healthy. To prevent misinterpretation, it is essential to establish objective estimates of chance performance. One approach is permuting sample labels and retraining the algorithm to generate “random” predictions, providing an empirical baseline for chance levels [[173](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR173 "Neto, E.C., Using permutations to detect, quantify and correct for confounding in machine learning predictions. arXiv preprint 
                  arXiv:1805.07465
                  
                , 2018.")]. This should be complemented with performance metrics robust to class imbalance or classification methods that incorporate weighting factors during optimization to account for under-represented classes [[174](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR174 "He H, Garcia EA. Learning from imbalanced data. IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng. 2009;21(9):1263–84.")].

#### Clinician interaction-related biases and resistance

The adoption of AI in healthcare relies on clinician trust, yet resistance persists due to concerns over reliability, workflow disruption, and medical mistrust shaped by historical disparities. *Alsheibani* et al*.*, using the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework, identified organizational, technological, and environmental barriers to AI adoption and stressed leadership’s role in overcoming them [[175](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR175 "Alsheibani, S.A., D. Cheung, and D. Messom, Factors inhibiting the adoption of artificial intelligence at organizational level: A preliminary investigation. Twenty-fifth Americas Conference on Information Systems, Cancun. 2019.")]. In addition, *Lee and Rich* emphasized perceptual and social factors, highlighting how historical mistrust shapes clinicians’ acceptance of AI [[176](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR176 "Lee, M.K. and K. Rich. Who is included in human perceptions of AI?: Trust and perceived fairness around healthcare AI and cultural mistrust.")]. While *Strohm* et al*.* found that unclear integration processes, variable trust, and uncertain clinical value limit adoption in radiology [[177](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR177 "Strohm L, et al. Implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in radiology: hindering and facilitating factors. Eur Radiol. 2020;30(10):5525–32.")]. *Cadario* et al. reported that insufficient understanding of AI algorithms and blurred decision-making roles drive resistance, recommending targeted education to strengthen engagement [[178](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR178 "Cadario R, Longoni C, Morewedge CK. Understanding, explaining, and utilizing medical artificial intelligence. Nat Hum Behav. 2021;5(12):1636–42.")]. Clinician resistance is reinforced by biased AI systems, making diverse data, regular audits, and continuous validation essential to build trust and ensure equitable use.

#### Patient interaction-related biases

Patient-related biases involve disparities in access and interaction with AI systems. Privilege bias arises when certain populations lack access to AI-enabled care or the necessary technology, reinforcing existing inequities [[179](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR179 "Unanah OV, Aidoo EM. The potential of AI technologies to address and reduce disparities within the healthcare system by enabling more personalized and efficient patient engagement and care management. World J Adv Res Rev. 2025;25(2):2643–64.")]. Informed mistrust reflects skepticism rooted in historical healthcare injustices, leading some to avoid care or conceal information. Agency bias results from patients’ limited roles in AI development and evaluation, meaning their needs and perspectives may be inadequately represented in AI-driven healthcare [[180](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR180 "Amann J, et al. Explainability for artificial intelligence in healthcare: a multidisciplinary perspective. BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2020;20(1):310.")].

### Strategies to mitigate bias

#### Data diversity and validation

Ensuring AI fairness starts with collecting and using diverse, representative data sets that reflect the full spectrum of patient demographics, conditions, and healthcare settings. This approach reduces biases and improves generalizability. Regular audits and independent validations by experts help detect and correct emerging biases. Healthcare institutions should implement continuous AI performance monitoring systems to adapt models over time as clinical environments evolve [[181](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR181 "Chen RJ, et al. Algorithmic fairness in artificial intelligence for medicine and healthcare. Nat Biomed Eng. 2023;7(6):719–42.")].

#### Education and awareness

Educating clinicians and patients about AI biases fosters critical use and informed decision-making. Clinicians trained on potential biases avoid over reliance and can better evaluate AI outputs, while informed patients engage more effectively in their care discussions. Promoting collaborative communication channels such as workshops and forums supports ongoing learning, user feedback, and iterative improvements to AI systems [[182](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR182 "Cross JL, Choma MA, Onofrey JA. Bias in medical AI: implications for clinical decision-making. PLoS Digit Health. 2024;3(11):e0000651.")].

#### Ethical and legal frameworks

Robust ethical and legal structures are essential for protecting patient privacy, ensuring data security, and defining clear accountability for AI-driven decisions [[7](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR7 "Shoghli A, Darvish M, Sadeghian Y. Balancing innovation and privacy: ethical challenges in AI-driven healthcare. J Rev Med Sci. 2024;4(1):1–11.")]. Obtaining informed consent and complying with regulations, such as HIPAA and GDPR safeguard data use. Clear liability frameworks allocate responsibility among clinicians, developers, and institutions. Enhancing algorithm explainability promotes transparency and trust, though awareness of explainability’s limitations is important to mitigate confirmation biases [[183](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR183 "Jurczuk M, Suprunowicz M. Consent in data privacy: a general comparison of GDPR and HIPAA. Przegląd Prawniczy Uniwersytetu im Adam Mickiewicza. 2024;16:173–94.")].

#### Stakeholder collaboration

Mitigating AI biases demands coordinated efforts from a wide range of stakeholders. Physicians provide essential clinical expertise, AI developers refine and optimize algorithms, and policymakers establish clear regulatory frameworks [[159](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR159 "Goktas P, Grzybowski A. Shaping the future of healthcare: ethical clinical challenges and pathways to trustworthy AI. J Clin Med. 2025;14(5):1605.")]. Patients and advocacy groups bring forward community perspectives and equity concerns, while professional associations define ethical standards. Such multidisciplinary collaboration is crucial to ensure that AI technologies are designed and implemented in a responsible, fair, and effective manner across healthcare systems [[184](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR184 "Addario BJ, et al. Patient value: perspectives from the advocacy community. Health Expect. 2018;21(1):57–63.")].

## Future perspectives and recommendations

The future of AI in healthcare will be driven by advances in computational power, algorithmic innovation, and the growing availability of multimodal data sets, including medical imaging, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and electronic health records. Integrating these data streams will enable highly precise diagnoses, personalized treatment planning, and dynamic, adaptive patient care. Future systems may integrate multi-omics data sets to model disease progression and simulate treatment outcomes through “digital twins” virtual patient replicas [[185](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR185 "Ali H. Artificial intelligence in multi-omics data integration: Advancing precision medicine, biomarker discovery and genomic-driven disease interventions. Int J Sci Res Arch. 2023;8(1):1012–30.")]. In drug discovery, advanced AI models, including quantum-enhanced systems, are being developed to simulate molecular behavior, predict off-target effects, and streamline compound screening [[186](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR186 "Ali H. Quantum computing and AI in healthcare: Accelerating complex biological simulations, genomic data processing, and drug discovery innovations. World J Adv Res Rev. 2023;20(2):1466–84.")]. In clinical practice, the evolution of explainable AI frameworks will be critical to ensure transparency, interpretability, and trust among healthcare providers. AI is also expected to reshape preventive medicine by identifying at-risk populations through predictive modeling and enabling early, personalized interventions. In oncology, the future lies in deeper AI-driven analyses of the tumor microenvironment, facilitating more individualized and adaptive immunotherapies.

Looking ahead, AI will not only optimize clinical workflows but also reshape healthcare delivery systems on a global scale. Lightweight and mobile-compatible AI solutions designed for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) could reduce disparities in access to high-quality care, provided infrastructure and capacity-building needs are met. Global collaborations, open-access data initiatives, and coordinated funding mechanisms will be central to ensuring that innovation is both equitable and sustainable. However, to realize these opportunities, several enabling conditions must be addressed, encompassing data diversity, regulatory frameworks, cost-effectiveness, and collaborative governance.

First, research must prioritize the creation of diverse, validated, and externally tested models to ensure fairness and reliability across populations and health systems. Initiatives such as the UK Biobank and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) exemplify efforts to promote data diversity, yet comparable frameworks remain limited in many regions. The lack of standardized, multiethnic data sets poses a major challenge, as biased training data can perpetuate inequities in diagnosis and treatment. The associated risk of non-generalizable or discriminatory outcomes can be mitigated by mandating independent benchmarking data sets, promoting international data-sharing under secure privacy-preserving conditions, and incorporating fairness audits into the development pipeline.

Second, policy must establish adaptive ethical and regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with accountability and transparency. Notable efforts include the U.S. FDA’s AI/ML-based SaMD Action Plan, the EU AI Act, and the World Health Organization’s guidance on ethics and governance of AI for health [[187](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR187 "Reddy S. Global harmonization of artificial intelligence-enabled software as a medical device regulation: addressing challenges and unifying standards. Mayo Clinic Proc Digit Health. 2025. 
                  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpdig.2024.100191
                  
                .")]. Despite these advances, many countries lack clear or enforceable guidelines, and the dynamic nature of learning systems complicates regulatory oversight. The risk of fragmented standards or regulatory lag can hinder both innovation and patient safety. To mitigate this, international harmonization platforms and regulatory sandboxes should be established to test emerging technologies under controlled conditions, ensuring safety while facilitating continuous adaptation [[188](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR188 "Palaniappan K, Lin EYT, Vogel S. Global regulatory frameworks for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare services sector. Healthcare. 2024. 
                  https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare12050562
                  
                .")].

Third, successful implementation will depend on prioritizing cost-effective, resource-efficient AI tools alongside workforce training and digital literacy. In LMICs, initiatives such as AI4Health Africa and PATH’s Digital Square demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, scalable AI applications, yet challenges persist in terms of infrastructure limitations, workforce capacity, and sustainable funding. Without targeted support, there is a risk of exacerbating the digital divide, leaving resource-limited settings further behind. This can be mitigated through blended investment models that combine public–private partnerships, international aid, and capacity-building programs to strengthen infrastructure while simultaneously training healthcare professionals in AI literacy and clinical integration [[189](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR189 "Ngcobo M. The ethics and law of medical AI in South Africa: balancing innovation with responsibility. SAMJ S Afr Med J. 2025;115(5B):75–9."), [190](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR190 "Signé, L., Strategies for effective health care for Africa in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Brookings, 2021.")].

Finally, global collaboration will be essential to enable scalable and equitable deployment of AI in healthcare. Initiatives such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium highlight the value of international data-sharing, but significant barriers remain, including data privacy concerns, interoperability issues, and geopolitical restrictions. The risk of data silos can limit generalizability and innovation. Federated learning and privacy-preserving computation offer mitigation strategies by allowing models to be trained on distributed data without compromising patient confidentiality. Furthermore, international agreements on data governance and equitable benefit-sharing will be essential to overcome geopolitical divides and ensure global access to AI-driven advances [[191](/article/10.1186/s40001-025-03196-w#ref-CR191 "Rehm HL, et al. GA4GH: international policies and standards for data sharing across genomic research and healthcare. Cell Genom. 2021. 
                  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2021.100029
                  
                .")].

In summary, the transformative potential of AI in healthcare is undeniable, but its realization will depend on addressing critical enablers and barriers. By grounding future developments in diverse data sets, adaptive policies, cost-effective implementation strategies, and international collaboration, AI can move from experimental promise to sustainable integration in clinical practice. At the same time, explicit recognition of the risk’s bias, regulatory gaps, inequitable access, and data fragmentation together with proactive mitigation strategies will ensure that AI evolves as a safe, ethical, and globally accessible tool for improving human health.

## Conclusion

Artificial intelligence is no longer a distant prospect but an integral component of modern healthcare, transforming diagnostics, drug discovery, precision medicine, and health system operations. However, for AI to progress from promising innovations to globally trusted solutions, stakeholders must go beyond proof-of-concept applications and focus on scalable, equity-driven implementation. Future success will depend on three critical priorities: developing algorithms trained on diverse and representative data sets; embedding cost-effectiveness and sustainability analyses into deployment strategies; and establishing global regulatory frameworks that ensure transparency, ethical responsibility, and patient safety. Equally important is the translation of AI tools into real-world clinical settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, through lightweight, resource-efficient models that address infrastructure gaps. Building clinician capacity through AI literacy and training will be essential for ensuring human oversight in decision-making. By aligning technological innovation with practical implementation, policy development, and global collaboration, AI can transition from incremental improvements to a reliable, equitable, and sustainable foundation for healthcare worldwide.
